# Climate-Change-Dashboard

We use matplotlib to create a climate change dashboard based on some publicly available emissions data from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

Dataset file: owid-co2-data.csv
Code Output: Visual_Output.png
## Usage

- Load the cleaned and processed dataset.
- Generate visualizations to analyze emissions trends over time.
- Explore key metrics and insights on global greenhouse gas emissions.

## Results

The dashboard highlights:
- Historical trends in CO2 emissions.
- Contributions by countries and regions to global greenhouse gas emissions.
- Year-over-year changes and patterns.

## Future Work

- Integrate real-time data updates.
- Add interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Dash.
- Incorporate additional climate indicators for deeper analysis.
